# AI Dev Process: Work spec creation

## Instructions

- Read:
  - `Submodules/ai-dev-process/Guides/Spec/work-spec-creation.md`
- Use 🟡 to mark TODOs and stopping points; when the human says "begin/next/continue", remove the 🟡 you're acting on and proceed.
- If the workflow needs project-specific commands/paths, read `docs/ai-dev-process/integration.md` and STOP to ask for missing required values.
