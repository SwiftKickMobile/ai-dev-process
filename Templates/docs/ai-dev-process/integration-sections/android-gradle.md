# Managed section: Android / Gradle

This section is maintained by `ai-dev-process` and merged into the host project’s Integration doc during install/update.

Do not edit this block directly in the host repo; instead, add overrides in the Integration doc’s “Special instructions / overrides” section.

## Android/Gradle

Goal: provide copy/pasteable, non-interactive `./gradlew` commands that agents can run (or humans can run and paste output/artifacts back).

🟡 The installer should fill these based on the repo’s Gradle setup (modules, variants/flavors) or ask the human for minimal missing values.

- 🟡 Build/compile command(s):
- 🟡 Unit tests (all):
- 🟡 Unit tests (single module / subset):
- 🟡 Instrumentation/UI tests (if applicable):
- 🟡 Where reports/results are written (e.g. `**/build/reports/**`, `**/build/test-results/**`):
