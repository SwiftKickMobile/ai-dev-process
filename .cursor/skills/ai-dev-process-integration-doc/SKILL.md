# AI Dev Process: Integration doc (installer behavior)

## Instructions

- Read `Install/integration-doc-install-update.md` and follow it as the source of truth.
- When editing templates, also read:
  - `Templates/docs/ai-dev-process/integration.md`
  - `Templates/docs/ai-dev-process/integration-sections/xcode.md`
  - `Templates/docs/ai-dev-process/integration-sections/swift-package.md`
  - `Templates/docs/ai-dev-process/integration-sections/android-gradle.md`
- Keep 🟡 only for missing constants/mappings; treat `<...>` placeholders as agent-filled variables.
