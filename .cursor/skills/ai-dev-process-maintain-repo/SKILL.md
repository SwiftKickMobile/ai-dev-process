# AI Dev Process: Maintain this repo

## Instructions

- Read `maintain-ai-dev-process.md` and follow it as the source of truth.
- If you touch Integration templates or behavior, also read `Install/integration-doc-install-update.md`.
- After any significant edit set (multi-file change, path moves, installer behavior changes, new assets/skills, integration template changes), run the checklist in `maintain-retro.md` and report only misses/follow-ups.
