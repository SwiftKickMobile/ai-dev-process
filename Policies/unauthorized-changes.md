# Do NOT Make Unauthorized Changes

Do not make code changes during discussion or troubleshooting unless explicitly authorized by the user. This rule applies especially when:

- Diagnosing issues or problems
- Responding to questions
- Explaining potential solutions
- Adding debug/logging statements

When identifying a solution, explain it and wait for authorization before implementing.

Exception: when the user explicitly requests the change (e.g., "make this change", "fix this", "implement X").
